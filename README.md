# Designing-Interactive-SVGs-with-AI

A short course for designers on making interactive SVGs with AI help. It will be presented as a [CreativeMornings FieldTrip](https://creativemornings.com/fieldtrips) in January 2026.

## Intro

[Presentation](https://steveturbek.github.io/Designing-Interactive-SVGs-with-AI/presentation.svg)

- Designers know design tools, but coding and interaction is often a challenge
- The SVG file format, known for icons, is unexpectedly, a powerful format similar to HTML. One can have style sheets and javascript in the file.
- SVG is a vector format, but is written in a language like HTML
- LLMs are great at manipulating language
- With proper set up, a designer can upload an image and collaborate the interaction into life!
- One can ‘round trip’ between Design tool and AI
- The SVG is now portable, contains its code.

## Background

I teach the "[Tangible Interfaces](https://steveturbek.github.io/Tangible-Interfaces/)" Senior Design Studio in the Industrial Design program at Pratt Institute.

In my workshop, the students designed a dashboard instrument (like on a car dashboard). (We are designing personal submarines)
I wrote a “Skill” to prep the AI to focus on the right thing, and use the right context. They had no coding experience, It was pretty magical….

The workshop is not specifically about dashboard elements. It is more conceptual reframing about design tools and AI, and rediscovering tools we designers always had.

## What is SVG and can it be cured?

## Why SVGs

### Interactive Color Wheel

Interactive SVGs can be a game changer for designers working with Devs.

I used it to ‘sneak’ interactivity into old codebases where we couldn’t touch the code, but we could upload an image to a Content Managment System.

I made this color wheel for our Goldman Sachs Design System (which was public when I lead the project). It is [available on Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220819072910/https://design.gs.com/home)

<!-- _Click the color wheel to open the interactive version in a new tab. Hover over any color segment to view its name, RGB values, and hex code. Click to lock the color information._
